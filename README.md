# AICrowd-AIBlitz7-Solution

In this repository there are my solutions to each problem. I only uploaded the code. To run the code the images of the dataset needs to be put into the folders /train, /val, and /test. More detailed descriptions about training and testing are in the challenges(number of challenge) folders. The .csv files have to be put into the data-folder.

### Hyperparameters shouldn't be changed also the batch size!!! A change will end up in a decrease in perfomance.

For each challenge there is a requirements.txt with the version I had at solving these tasks. To make sure that it works you should install the packages with the same version
